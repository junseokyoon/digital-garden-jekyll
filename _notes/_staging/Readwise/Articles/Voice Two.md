## Highlights
- Maybe I should find that unsettling, since the voice is just a construct of my own mind. It’s not a separate personality, or anything so grandiose and sinister. It’s just an embodiment of self-reassurance that I rely on sometimes. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/602620477/1243261))
- Yours probably has something of your parents in it, or their parents, or a beloved schoolteacher, or even a mentor you’ve chosen - maybe from real life, or even from fantasy. Perhaps your darker moments are blunted by the unflappable poise of Captain Picard, or Dr. Greg House, or the tone you project upon your preferred deity.

- The voice is a corresponding adaption. The creative’s equivalent of white blood cells, producing antibodies for the mind. If you think of it that way, it’s something to be profoundly grateful for, not ashamed of. It means that everything is still working. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/602620477/1243313))

- We struggle against these overlapping and diverging elements of ourselves, standing at the centre of the cacophony. To anthropomorphise these facets as actual voices is simply the sane thing to do. It’d be crazy not to. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/602620477/1243324))
- Voice Two is just another in the crowd, albeit one I’ve made for myself. An ally, ever ready to quietly remind me that I’ve got this far, and it’s probably not all coming to an end quite yet.
  A more capable and reassuring presence, for when I can’t muster the required calmness and poise on my own.
  It’s going to be alright, mate, it says, when I most need it to. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/602620477/1243325))
