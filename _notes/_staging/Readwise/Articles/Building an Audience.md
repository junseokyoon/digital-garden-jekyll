## Highlights
- For those who are still here, let me reveal the big secret. Like anything worth a damn, there are three steps.
  Write things. Not other people’s things; your own. Publish those things on your site.
  Say interesting and/or amusing things on social media – pithy observations are good – and occasionally link to the things you published on your site. Try to balance self-promotion with politeness. When in doubt, go for the latter.
  Keep doing it for years. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/596139602/1448458))
    - Note: 독자를 만들기 위한 방법 세가지.
      첫째, 뭐라도 써라. 남들 것이 아닌 자기만의 글을 당신의 공간에 올려라.
      둘째, 소셜 미디어에 흥미를 끌만한 내용을 올려라. 그리고 때때로 당신 글의 링크를 달아라.
      셋째, 위 사항을 꾸준히 하라.
