## Highlights
- #1: A Cross-Reference Library for my Sermon Notes
  This is what got me into Obsidian. I create a new note for each sermon, embed my sketchnote, and link to every verse mentioned. Then I can use the local graph to navigate from note -> verse -> note in my personal study.

- #2: A Repository of My Book Notes
  Each book has its own mind map and outline, then I break apart key ideas into their own "atomic notes" so I can link them to other books that mention those same ideas.

- #3: My Writing Tool
  I do all of my writing in Obsidian, whether it's for a blog post, newsletter, video script, or article. I use kanban boards to track progress for writing projects, and Hazel keeps my folders clean by archiving them automatically based on metadata.

- #4: My Personal Journal
  I use the Tracker +Daily Notes plugins to practice the Daily Questions format from Marshall Goldsmith. I also use QuickAdd to add text entries for significant events, gratitude, and any learnings I want to capture.

- #5: A Podcast Index
  I create a note for each podcast I have a hand in creating, and embed the links/notes as well the audio file for each episode. I also include metadata where appropriate (i.e. book ratings for @bookwormfm).

- #6: A Collection of Course Notes
  I've recently gone through a couple of courses, and I've kept a single note for each course that I keep adding to. Each session gets its own section, and I use callouts to highlight important information.

- #7: Archive of My Personal Retreats
  My quarterly personal retreats always bring a ton of clarity. I have a text-based template set up in Obsidian that facilitates my thinking time questions and the Charts View plugin lets me recreate my wheel of life.

- #8: My Task Manager
  A few months ago I started keeping all my tasks in Obsidian. Using the Obsidian Tasks plugin, I'm able to add things like start/due dates to tasks and use queries to pull in tasks from anywhere in my vault.

- TL;DR - I use Obsidian for:
  â€¢ Cross-referencing sermon sketchnotes
  â€¢ Connecting book notes & mind maps
  â€¢ All of my writing
  â€¢ My digital journal
  â€¢ A podcast archive
  â€¢ Course notes
  â€¢ Personal retreats
  â€¢ Task management
  And tying it all together is the Graph.

- I've never been a fan of everything apps, but Osbdiain is different:
  â€¢ It's plain text, so it's future-proof
  â€¢ It uses standard Markdown, so my files will work in any other editor
  â€¢ The plugin architecture lets you make it whatever you want
  â€¢ The community is amazing

- If you're looking to make the most of @obsdmd, I helped build this comprehensive course for @thesweetsetup (course page says 40 videos, it's actually more like 60 now): https://t.co/AaXwJ0j8fT
