## Highlights
- There is hot coffee to the left of my keyboard. My keyboard, well, it’s about as clicky and awesome as they come. I put in my earbuds, hit play on the soundtrack, and set a 30 minute timer.
  My phone is in Do Not Disturb mode. So is my computer. The outside world can wait. For the next half hour I’m pushing the cursor.
  This is my writing routine. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/596689291/1233574))
    - Note: 글쓰기 루틴. 아침에 일어나 핫커피를 두고 이어폰으로 음악(모뉴먼트 밸리 OST)를 들으며 30분 타이머를 맞춤. 폰과 컴퓨터는 방해금지모드로 설정해 외부의 방해를 잠시 차단함.
- Now, I write at 7:30am. If I don’t feel like it, too bad. I can at least suffer through 30 minutes of mud. But what’s wild is that most days it takes just 5 or 10 minutes for the writing to start feeling pretty good. Or, if the writing sucks, at least the calm of it being just my coffee and my words begins to take over and even if I’m not feeling in the zone, I at least feel comfortable putting my thoughts down.

    - Note: 아침 7시 반에 일어나 글을 쓴다. 5~10분 안에 바로 집중이 되지만, 안될 때는 커피를 마시며 마음을 안정시킨 후 생각을 적어내려간다.
- By giving myself no room for wiggling around or making excuses, I’ve found that having this set time to write means I actually write more than if I were to wait only for inspiration to strike. I write more words in general (usually 1,500 words every day) than days when I wait for inspiration. And my writing is of a higher quality — my crappy first drafts are much less crappy.
  And, though my timer is set for 30 minutes, more often than not by the time the half-hour is up, I’m firing on all cylinders and I will continue to write for another hour or three. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/596689291/1233586))
    - Note: 스스로 주변환경을 제한시켜 나오는 글이 영감이 떠올라서 쓰는 글보다 더 길고 퀄리티가 더 좋다. 30분 타이머를 정해뒀지만, 1시간이나 3시간을 넘겨 계속 글쓰기를 이어가는데 전력을 다 한다.
- Right now I rarely write on the weekends and I can totally feel it on Monday mornings — not only am I starving to write by Monday, but I feel rusty when I do. Imagine that, after just two days off I can tell a difference. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/596689291/1233589))
    - Note: 주말엔 글을 쓰지 않는데 월요일 아침이 되면 글쓰기에 굶주려 있을 뿐 아니라 감각이 무뎌져 있다는 걸 느낀다.
- The truth is that my writing for this morning began yesterday when I put that note on my desk. That note is my topic for the day. That note is the single most important element of my personal productivity system. Because that note is the single most important thing I have to do today.

    - Note: 사실 오늘의 글쓰기는 하루 전날 '그날의 주제'를 정할 때부터 시작되었다. 주제를 적은 노트를 책상 위에 올려놓고 그 때부터 생각을 한다.
- Writing the topic that I’m going to write about tomorrow gives me a few advantages:
  It gives my subconscious a 12-hour head start. The well of my writing mind gets the whole night to fill itself up with what it wants to say on the topic. I don’t have to be anxious and keep it at the front of my mind, wasting my time and energy thinking about. Tomorrow is when I will write about it.
  Thus, when it comes time to write, I have all my energy at my disposal. When I sit down to write, I haven’t yet spent any of my willpower on trying to muster up an idea, or comb through a list of possibilities, or scour the internet looking for inspiration. It’s time to write and I am not desperate. Nor am I lost, dazed, or confused. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/596689291/1233618))
    - Note: 미리 주제를 정해두기 때문에 무엇을 다룰지 12시간 동안 생각할 수 있고, 글을 써야 할 시간에 망설임 없이 시작할 수 있다. 다른 자료를 찾지 않고 쭉 쓴다.
